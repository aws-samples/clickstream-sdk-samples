If using a tab or drawer navigator, it's a bit more complex because all of the screens in the navigator might be rendered at once and kept rendered - that means that the last StatusBar config you set will be used (likely on the final tab of your tab navigator, not what the user is seeing).
Usage: <FocusAwareStatusBar barStyle="light-content" backgroundColor="#6a51ae" />

# SwiftUI-FakeShopping-App
A shopping app fully made in SwiftUI for iOS 14.1.

The app is fully made in SwiftUI, it uses [Fake-Store-API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to get the products with a custom category picker.
When logged in, a user is randomly generated by [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/)

the black and white theme is made because the product API returns a jpg image with a white background, i adapted the design to that.
